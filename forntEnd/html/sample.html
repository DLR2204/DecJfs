<marquee direction="left" scrollamount="5" bgcolor="yellow"><font face="Lucida Handwriting"> Maria Trubnikova (6 January 1835 – 28 April 1897) was a Russian feminist and activist. From a wealthy family, she was orphaned at a young age and raised by her aunt. She married Konstantin Trubnikov at the age of 19; they had seven children. Trubnikova hosted a women-only salon which became a center of feminist activism. Alongside Anna Filosofova and Nadezhda Stasova, whom she mentored, Trubnikova was one of the earliest leaders of the Russian women's movement; the three women were referred to as the "triumvirate". They founded several organizations designed to promote women's cultural and economic independence, as well as pushing for higher education for women. Trubnikova maintained international connections to fellow feminists in England, France, and other countries. Over time, her once-liberal husband grew implacably opposed to her activism, and they separated. Trubnikova later experienced severe illness; she died in an asylum in 1897.</font></marquee>
